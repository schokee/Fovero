# Fovero
.Net tools for maze generation and solving.

## Features

### Maze Formats

- Rectangular
- Truncated Square
- Dijon
- Palazzo
- Lattice
- Pyramid
- Hexagons
- Circular

### Generation Algorithms

- [Hunt and Kill](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/24/maze-generation-hunt-and-kill-algorithm)
: mazes with a mix of long corridors and dead ends.

- [Kruskal's](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/3/maze-generation-kruskal-s-algorithm): mazes with minimal path redundancy.
 
- [Prim's](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking): mazes with a more uniform distribution of paths.
 
- Prim's (Mixed)
- Prim's (Oldest)
- [Recursive Backtracker](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking): mazes with a depth-first search approach, resulting in long, winding paths.
- [Wilson's](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/20/maze-generation-wilson-s-algorithm):  mazes with a uniform distribution of paths.

### Solver Algorithms
- A* Euclidean
- A* Manhattan
- Breadth-first Search
- Depth-first Search
- Random walk
